# Quizz-Pro

## Purpose
This website was created to provide light-hearted entertainment for users through the medium of online quizzes.  On the homepage (index.html) the user has the option of entering a username if they so wish.  The user can also choose not to answer every question, as their intent may just be to learn where a particular quote originated from, rather than to test their knowledge.
Quiz content comprises quotes from the movies made famous by the movie or the actor.
The website currently has two quizzes:
* Famous Movie Quotes - this quiz has an easier difficulty level, as it contains well known quotes from popular movies.
* Famous Actor Quotes - this quiz has a higher difficulty level, as quotes are attributed to the actor that said them, rather than to the movie itself. This quiz also has a year displayed in brackets after the quote - eg: (1951) - as there may have been later or earlier releases of the particular movie from which they are taken.

The website pages are as follows:
* Home page (index.html)
* Famous Movie Quotes Quiz
* Famous Actor Quotes Quiz
* Contact Us
* Terms of Service

### Design of the Quizz-Pro website

#### Colour Scheme
The colour palette chosen consists of three basic colours: #ADD8E6(light blue); #FFC0CB (pink); and #ADFF2F (greenyellow).  The body text is mostly #FFFFFF (white) and the background is #000000 (black).  The colours were chosen to compliment each other and provide the necessary contrasts.

#### Fonts
The logo; logo byline; and quiz pages' main heading are using **Windsong**; all other headings are using **Mitr**; and the body text is using **Comfortaa**.  The back-up font is **sans-serif**.  Fonts were downloaded from **Google Fonts**.

#### Imagery
Images for the website have been downloaded from **Pexels** and compressed and pixelated for a fast-loading website, using **tinyjpg**.

#### Limitations
This website has been designed to not retain user information, with username information only being stored within the local storage feature (in developer tools) on the user's device.

## Features
* The home page has a feature allowing the user to enter a username, should they wish to.  There is no limitation on this field and letters, numbers or special characters may be entered.  This field is totally optional.  If a username is entered, a greeting will be displayed to the user. <br>
The username field can be found [here](assets/images/feature_username_comp.jpg) <br>
The username greeting can be found [here](assets/images/feature_username_result_if_username_entered_comp.jpg)
* A Countdown Timer set to 70 seconds has been added for the 'Actor Quotes Quiz' and the 'Movie Quotes Quiz' pages.  If the timer expires before the user completes the quiz, the onscreen timer will display a message warning the user that after a delay of 5 seconds - the timer will automatically reset (reload) the page, move to the top of the page and restart.<br>
The countdown timer can be found [here](assets/images/feature_countdown-timer_comp.jpg)<br>
The countdown expiry message can be found [here](assets/images/feature_timer-expiry_comp.jpg)
* Clicking the Reset Button will also reset (reload) the page, move to the top of the page and restart the countdown timer. This button can be selected by the user at any time.<br>
The reset button can be found [here](assets/images/feature_reset-button_comp.jpg)
* If the user submits their answers and then decides to re-attempt the quiz, they will need to click the Reset Button to 'clear' their answers and results, reload the page and restart the timer.
* The Submit Button tallies the user's score comparing their answers against correct answers.  Upon clicking this button, the countdown timer will be halted.  This allows the user to assess their own time taken to complete the quiz against the displayed seconds remaining.<br>
The submit button can be found [here](assets/images/feature_submit-button_comp.jpg)
* The user's quiz results and score will appear underneath the Submit Button, when this button is clicked by the user. Only the answers for the incorrectly and/or unanswered questions, will be displayed - along with the appropriate correct answer. On the 'Actor Quotes Quiz' and the 'Movie Quotes Quiz' pages, a congratulatory message will display should the user achieve a 10/10 score. An alternative encouraging message will appear should the user achieve less than 10/10. Messages will contain the username if entered via the home page username field.  Alternatively the same message will be displayed, but without a username.<br>
Alternative message *with* a username can be found [here](assets/images/feature_user-results-container_with_username_comp.jpg) <br>
Alternative message *without* a username can be found [here](assets/images/feature_user-results-container_comp.jpg) <br>

## Technologies

* HTML - the structure of this website project uses HTML as the main language.
* CSS - the styling of this website encompasses custom written CSS.
* Javascript - website interaction provided by custom written Javascript.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - utilised for the logo, byline and quiz page main heading (Windsong); the remaining headings (Mitr); and the body text (Comfortaa).
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - hosting site for storage of source code for the website and [Git Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the deployment of the website.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - used as version control software to commit and push code to a GitHub repository where all source code is located.
* [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) - these are built in developer tools used to inspect page elements (eg. responsive design; debug issues; testing of different CSS styling options; and the Lighthouse Report.
* [tinyjpg](https://tinyjpg.com/) - used for compression of .jpg images to allow for faster web page loading times.
* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) - selection of images for Quizz-Pro website.
* [ami.responsivedesign](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) - used to generate Mockup of Quizz-Pro Website.

## Testing
* Testing will be performed to check for back-end functionality (Javascript), as well as visual effects and website layout (HTML and CSS).
* Testing will be performed to check for compatibility across three web browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera).
* Responsive design will be tested across the different screen sizes: desktops/laptops (1024px); tablets (max-width 769px); mobiles (to a max-width of 426px); and large laptops (min-width 1025px to max-width 1441px).
* All navigational links should direct to the correct html web page as per their names.  The exception here is the 'Home' page, as it will redirect to 'index.html'.

#### Testing Issues and Resolutions
* **Countdown Timer:** <br>
*Issue*: Several different timer options were tried and found to not work across one or more of the three different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera).  When a countdown timer was finally found to work across all browsers, it was then shown to affect all the Quizz-Pro website pages - in that each of the five webpages (not just the required 'Actor Quotes Quiz' and the 'Movie Quotes Quiz' pages) would 'reload' and jump to the top of the page after 70 seconds, thereby providing a disruptive experience for the user. <br>
*Resolution*: enclosing the timer within an 'if statement' where the timer would only operate if the HTML div element with the id:'countdown' was detected.  This html element 'countdown' is only present on the 'Actor Quotes Quiz' and the 'Movie Quotes Quiz' pages and is where the visible countdown timer would be displayed to the user.
* **The resetQuiz() function in Javascript:** <br>
*Issue*: This function included a 'location.reload()' method, intended to reload the page, clear away the users answers and quiz results and restart the countdown timer.  It was found that Firefox does not support the reload() method, or the alternative 'history.go(0)' method.<br>
*Resolution*: the 'window.location.href' method was found to work across all browsers.
* **Image on Home Page:** <br>
*Issue*: The image on the home page (popcorn) demonstrated continual layout problems on Firefox, and produced a low result in the lighthouse report - in spite of several different images being tried and tested for compatibility and website responsiveness.<br> 
*Resolution*: this was resolved through the calling of three different images (sized according to device type) via CSS using the 'content: url()' option.
* An attempt was made to add aria-labels to the website buttons and links, but this was abandoned when the 'performance' section of the lighthouse reports, dropped dramatically into the 'low orange' values.

### Code Validation
* All five HTML pages were run through the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and showed no errors. The following web pages were checked: index.html (home page); actor_quotes_quiz.html; movie_quotes_quiz.html; terms_of_service.html; contact_us.html.
* The CSS stylesheet was run through the [CSS Validation Service-Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and showed no errors. [CSS screenshot](assets/images/CSS_code_validation_comp.jpg).
* The Javascript file was run through the [JSHint Validation Service](https://jshint.com) and showed no errors.<br>
*Note*: The following message displayed:  'Two unused variables:  submitQuiz() and resetQuiz()'.  Both of these variables are called from within both the html quiz pages: *'Actor Quotes Quiz'* and *'Movie Quotes Quiz'*. [JSHint screenshot](assets/images/JSHint_code_validation_comp.jpg).
