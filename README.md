# Quizz-Pro

## Purpose
This website was created to provide entertainment for users through the medium of online quizzes.
Quiz content comprises quotes from the movies made famous by the film and/or the actor.
The website is currently comprised of two quizzes:
* Famous Movie Quotes - this quiz has an easier difficulty level, as it comprises well known quotes from popular movies/films.
* Famous Actor Quotes - this quiz has a higher difficulty level, as quotes are attributed to the actor that said them, rather than the movie/film. This quiz also has a year displayed in brackets - eg: (1951) - after the quote, as there may have been later releases of the particular movie from which they are taken.

The website pages are as follows:
* Home page
* Famous Movie Quotes Quiz
* Famous Actor Quotes Quiz
* Contact Us
* Terms of Service
